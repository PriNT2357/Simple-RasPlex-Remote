# RasPlex Remote

With this .html file, you can easily control your RasPlex from any browser. The genius behing this remote is [Michael Page](https://github.com/Error-freeIT), i've only made some design changes (double resolution, dark theme).

PS: I'm running RasPlex on a Raspberry Pi 3.

## Planned changes

- mobile version (bookmark, app-like behaviour in browser)
- combine all depencies in one file (portability)

Estimate: N/A
